# Page-replacement
Step-by-Step Guide to Page Replacement Program
1. Functionality Overview:
The Page Replacement program implements three different page replacement algorithms: LRU (Least Recently Used), Optimal, and FIFO (First In First Out). These algorithms simulate the management of memory pages to minimize the number of page faults, i.e., the times a page needs to be replaced in memory.

2. Understanding the Algorithms:
a. LRU (Least Recently Used):
This algorithm replaces the least recently used page in memory when a new page needs to be loaded.
It tracks the order of page access to determine which page has been least recently used.
b. Optimal:
Similar to LRU, but instead of tracking the order of access, it looks ahead to see which page won't be used for the longest time.
It predicts which page won't be used for the longest time in the future and replaces it when a new page needs to be loaded.
c. FIFO (First In First Out):
This algorithm replaces the oldest page in memory when a new page needs to be loaded.
It follows a first-in, first-out approach, where the page that entered memory earliest is the first to be replaced.
3. Instructions for Execution:
a. Install Python:
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: Python Downloads.
b. Download the Program:
Download the Page Replacement program file (page_replacement.py) from the provided source.
c. Run the Program:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the page_replacement.py file is located.
Run the program by executing the following command:
Copy code
python page_replacement.py
d. Provide Input:
Enter the page reference string when prompted. The page reference string should be a comma-separated list of integers.
Enter the number of frames when prompted. This specifies the number of memory frames available for page replacement.
e. View Output:
The program will execute the LRU, Optimal, and FIFO algorithms based on the provided input.
It will display the step-by-step simulation of each algorithm, including whether it's a hit or a fault, the current memory contents, and the total number of page faults.
At the end of each algorithm simulation, the program will display the total number of page faults incurred.
f. Repeat Execution:
You can rerun the program with different input parameters to analyze the performance of the algorithms with different scenarios.
